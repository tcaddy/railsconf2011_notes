BRIDGING THE GAP - USING JAVASCRIPT IN RAILS TO WRITE DRY RICH CLIENT APPLICATIONS

JS is cool and great, but can have some drawbacks.

Problem: repitition of code in JS and Ruby:
  * Ruby in Javascript:
    * doesn't really work, but fun for a toy
  * Javascript in Ruby:
    * Ruby Racer - uses V8 js processing engine in Ruby
      * easy to use
      * you can add new js functions by writing Ruby class methods
      * you can write js functions that can be called by Ruby (using V8)

Idioms / Structure
  * The Javascript Way:
    * Standard Library for JS:
      * CommonJS, CommonJS Modules
      * Nodejs, V8
    * CommonJS Module:
      * exports a public API
      * You can use Ruby modules to write a CommonJS modules (and use them with IncludeJS)

Future of JS and Rails:
  * not sure if new include sytanx for Rails/JS/CoffeeScript is the best way to go.

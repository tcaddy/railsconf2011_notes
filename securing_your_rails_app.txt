Securing Your Rails Application

Rails defaults are actually pretty good for security, but you still need to learn about this.

Don't trust browser, don't trust database; trust the app server

SQL injection prevention - use question mark in conditions

White List is better than Black List
  * use attr_accessible (white list), not attr_protected (black list)
  
Session Keys:
  * Read "A Lesson in Timing Hacks" article for explanation

Detect social network authentication status:
  * using js in client can make a call to FB and find out if user is logged in

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
  * HTML escape user submitted data when re-displaying data in view (use <=h %> in pre Rails3; don't use <%=raw %> in Rails3)
  * whitelist HTML tags if you need to allow HTML tags (or use Markdown, Redcloth, Textile, etc)
  * do not use a black list, do not try to correct malicious code
  * use sanitize Rails helper and don't try to write your own

Authentication != Authorization
  * Authentication: who are you?
  * Authorization: who do you want?  or What are you allowed to do?
    * don't blindly accept params[:id] or params[:xxx_id] values. Make sure user is allowed to access the record identified by id
    * do this (check for current_user 1st to avoid whiny nils):  
      if @whatever=current_user.whatevers.find(params[:whatever_id])
        # everything is safe and OK
      else
        # bad user.  deny!!!
      end

CanCan by Ryan Bates:
  * good authorization scheme

CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery):
  * the authenticity token thing for form submits is a good thing
  * XSS can still default CSRF (when user clicks on something they shouldn't)
  * SSL - can prevent a lot of stuff - Strict Site Security (I think is the name, slide moved by too fast)
    * offer users an option to always use SSL
    OR
    * just force SSL for everything during login, while logged in, and until logout (after logout, really)

Security patches:
  * keep up to date.
  * even older versions of rails get security patches.  Updating a minor release is easy.
  * monitor plugins and gems for updates, too
  * OS updates, of course, too
  * join the Rails security updates mailing list
  * try to upgrade to Rails3

Do a security audit:
  * you need a fresh set of eyes to find the vulnerabilities that you don't see

Be aware (think like a hacker)
